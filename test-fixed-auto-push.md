# Test Fixed Auto-Push

Testing the corrected post-commit hook that should automatically push git notes.

## Changes made:
- Removed infinite loop pre-push hook
- Fixed post-commit hook to use direct spawn instead of dynamic import
- Should now reliably push notes after each commit

This commit should show both:
1. "Added claude-was-here note to commit xxxxxx"
2. "ðŸ“¤ Pushed git notes to remote"
