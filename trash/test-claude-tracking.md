# Test Claude Tracking - Updated

This file is created by Claude Code to test the git notes tracking system.

## Features being tested:
- ✅ Git notes creation on commit
- ✅ Automatic notes pushing to remote  
- ✅ GitHub Actions notes collection
- ✅ PR squashing notes preservation

## Expected behavior:
1. This file creation should be tracked in git notes
2. Notes should be automatically pushed to remote after commit
3. GitHub Actions should find these notes in the PR
4. Post-merge workflow should consolidate notes on squashed commit
5. **NEW**: This modification should also be tracked with specific line numbers

## Test Results:
- Previous tests showed the system is working correctly
- GitHub Actions now successfully fetches notes from remote
- Commits with Claude contributions are properly identified
- Ready for end-to-end testing of the squashing workflow

## Additional test content:
This is an additional paragraph added by Claude to generate more substantial changes that should be tracked in the git notes system. The claude-was-here system should record exactly which lines were modified or added by Claude Code.

Let's see if the claude-was-here system properly tracks this updated contribution!
