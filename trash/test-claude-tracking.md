# Test Claude Tracking

This file is created by Claude Code to test the git notes tracking system.

## Features being tested:
- Git notes creation on commit
- Automatic notes pushing to remote
- GitHub Actions notes collection
- PR squashing notes preservation

## Expected behavior:
1. This file creation should be tracked in git notes
2. Notes should be automatically pushed to remote
3. GitHub Actions should find these notes in the PR
4. Post-merge workflow should consolidate notes on squashed commit

Let's see if the claude-was-here system properly tracks this contribution!
