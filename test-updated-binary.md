# Test Updated Binary

This tests the updated binary that should automatically push git notes in the post-commit hook.

After installing the corrected binary, this commit should show both:
1. "Added claude-was-here note to commit xxxxxx" âœ…
2. "ðŸ“¤ Pushed git notes to remote" âœ…

If it works, GitHub Actions will immediately find the notes without manual push!
