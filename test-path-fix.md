# Test Path Fix

This file tests the fix for absolute path conversion in the post-merge workflow.

The GitHub Actions post-merge script should now:
1. Convert absolute paths like `/home/z/Desktop/work/claude-was-here/test-path-fix.md` 
2. To relative paths like `test-path-fix.md`
3. Successfully find and validate the file
4. Include it in the consolidated git notes on the squashed commit

This should result in proper consolidated notes instead of empty ones!
