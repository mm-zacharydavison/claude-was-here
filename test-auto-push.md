# Test Auto-Push Configuration

This file tests whether git notes are automatically pushed when using regular `git push` commands.

## Expected behavior:
1. Commit creates git notes ✅
2. `git push origin branch-name` automatically pushes both commits AND notes ✅
3. GitHub Actions can immediately find the notes ✅

## Configuration used:
- `remote.origin.push = +refs/heads/*:refs/heads/*`
- `remote.origin.push = +refs/notes/*:refs/notes/*`

This should eliminate the need for manual notes pushing!
